# Single-cell RNA sequencing study in colorectal cancer

Single-cell RNA sequencing has greatly expanded our ability to unravel how cells communicate within the
complex tumour microenvironment. In this study, a detailed exploration of cellâ€“cell communication (CCC)
networks in colorectal cancer (CRC) was done by integrating advanced computational frameworks with
modern machine learning strategies.  

**CellChat** and **NicheNet** were applied to map intercellular signaling patterns with emphasis on the
tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) subtypes. To complement these analyses, machine learning models
such as **XGBoost classification**, **deep learning embeddings**, and **neural networks** were incorporated
to capture latent structures and interaction predictions.  

Together, these approaches are robust and reveal consistent communication pathways but also
subtype-specific differences, with **C1QC+ TAMs** emerging as immune interface regulators and **SPP1+ TAMs**
as drivers of stromal remodeling.  

By implementing different computational methods, a multidimensional picture of CCC was produced.  
This work underscores the value of integrative analysis in advancing rigor in cancer systems biology.
